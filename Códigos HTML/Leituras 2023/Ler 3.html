            <CENTER><strong>The Diamond</strong></CENTER>

            Death walks alongside me,
            But the reaper is no match for me.
            I'm trapped in a world full of monsters dressed as men, and those who aren't as they seem.
            They won't keep me forever.
            I no longer recognize the person I've become,
            And I'm fighting to find my way back to the beast who hunts me in the night.
            They call me a diamond,
            But they've only created an angel of death.

        <CENTER><strong>The Hunter</strong></CENTER>
        
            I was born a predator,
            With ruthlessness ingrained in my bones.
            When what's mine is stolen from me in the night,
            Like a diamond hidden within a fortress,
            I find that I can no longer contain the beast.
            Blood will paint the ground as I tear apart this world to find her.
            And bring her back to where she belongs.
            No one will escape my wrath,
            Especially not those who have betrayed me.

            Warning: This is the second and final installment to the Duet. You must read Haunting Adeline first.
